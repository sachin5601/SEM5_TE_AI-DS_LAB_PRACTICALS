AIM -  Data Preprocessing Using Binning Method

Theory -


Data binning is a data preprocessing technique that groups numeric data into discrete bins or categories. It can be used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models,
reduce the size of the dataset, and make the data more interpretable. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as:

1] To improve the accuracy of machine learning models.
2] To reduce the size of the dataset.
3] To make the data more interpretable.

There are two main types of binning strategies: equal-width binning and equal-frequency binning.

1] Equal-width binning: This strategy divides the range of values into intervals of equal width.
2] Equal-frequency binning: This strategy divides the data into intervals so that each interval contains the same number of data points.


CONCLUSION -

Data binning is a simple but powerful data preprocessing technique that can improve the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning models, reduce the size of datasets,
and make data more interpretable. It is a widely used technique in data science and machine learning.
