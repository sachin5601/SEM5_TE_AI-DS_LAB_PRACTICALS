EXPERIMENT NO 3

3. Write simple programs using PROLOG as an AI programming Language:-

Theory:- 
This Prolog program defines a family tree. The first few lines of code (female(pam). male(tom). male(bob). female(liz). female(ann). female(pat). male(jim).) 
define the genders of the people in the family tree. The next line (parent(pam,bob).) defines that Pam is Bob's mother. The following lines of code define the other parent-child relationships in the family tree.
The next three lines of code (mother(X,Y):- parent(X,Y),female(X). father(X,Y):- parent(X,Y),male(X). grandparent(X,Y):-parent(X,Z),parent(Z,Y).) 
define the predicates mother, father, and grandparent. The mother(X,Y) predicate states that X is the mother of Y if X is a parent of Y and X is female. 
The father(X,Y) predicate states that X is the father of Y if X is a parent of Y and X is male. The grandparent(X,Y) predicate states that X is the grandparent of Y if X is a parent of Z and Z is a parent of Y.

For example, the following query would return true: mother(pam,bob).
This query asks if Pam is the mother of Bob. The predicate mother(X,Y) is true if X is the mother of Y, and the first line of code (female(pam).) states that Pam is female. 
Therefore, the query returns true.

# Here are some other queries that you could ask:

1] Is Tom the father of Liz? (parent(tom,liz).)
2] Is Ann the grandparent of Jim? (grandparent(ann,jim).)
3] Who are the parents of Pat? (parent(X,pat).)

How To Execute  This in College Lab:-
Step - 1 = In Linux/Ubuntu Go To Text Editor and Paste This

female(pam).
male(tom).
male(bob).
female(liz).
female(ann).
female(pat).
male(jim).
parent(pam,bob).
parent(tom,bob).
parent(tom,liz).
parent(bob,ann).
parent(bob,pat).
parent(pat,jim).
mother(X,Y):- parent(X,Y),female(X).
father(X,Y):- parent(X,Y),male(X).
grandparent(X,Y):-parent(X,Z),parent(Z,Y).

Step - 2 = SAVE This in .pl Extension in Desktop
Step - 3 = Go to Command Line Type cd Desktop
Step - 4 = Then, swipl -s filename.pl
Step - 5 = Enter this Queries 1] grandparent(X,Y).
                              2] mother(X,Y).
                              3] males(X) after Type Yes
